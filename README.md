Pseudocode 
The program starts with a main function that contains a switch statement. This switch statement lists some menu options and the last option allows the user to create their own burger. If the user inputs the fifth option, the switch statement then calls many methods which then prompt the user with customizable options. All of the options list the available options for that category in an array and then scans what the user inputs. This input is then sent back to the original switch statement and the next method is called. For the “Veggie” option, since multiple options in that category are usually selected, I added a Boolean which is changed to false when the user is done selecting their veggies. When all of the methods are called, in order to calculate the cost, I directly translated each menu option into an int that is equal to a value. The method plugs in the ingredients as a string which is then matched to an int with a value. The customer is then prompted at the end with a total.

The purpose of this program is to provide an easy way to customize a burger at a burger joint. As technology advances a lot of customer interaction can be redirected to apps which help streamline the processes. Especially with apps like Uber Eats, restaurants or more specifically burger places will have a better synergy with these newer apps. I believe my core audience would be people that are hungry but not too hungry because they have the patience to customize their food options. In a business sense this implantation may be taxing on the chef due to the lack of cookie cutter recipes. However, at the cost of some efficiency, you make a product that a person is guaranteed to like. Not only that but the customizable options are themselves simple in order to work with the same ingredients as the staple options. In a technical sense, the program is very bare bones and has little efficiency when it comes to converting the strings into ints with values. That being said, if online / off cashier ordering became staple in many fast food places, it will not only better suit the environment that we are in currently, but also make the ordering process a lot more efficient. With my code I try to mimic that system in order to wet my hands of the whole process. Although this code is extremely rough around the corners, I do believe with enough practice with real world applications, I will be able to improve both my code and the concepts surrounding them.
